### Ruby Solutions

This repo contains a number of possible Ruby solutions to possible coding samples and tests used during Ruby/Rails interviews.
These may not be the best, fastest, or most efficient solutions, but they worked and were exactly what I needed in order to solve the designated exampled.


*** I will continue to add problems and solutions as I come across more in my journeys.
